## Get hints in your IDE

I built a Swift library called [JustSugar](https://swiftpackageindex.com/mesqueeb/justsugar) to help new Swift developers coming from TypeScript. Just sugar does two things:

1. Adds useful Array and String methods inspired by JS like `.at`, `.slice`, `.join`, etc.
2. Adds all the most common JS Array and String methods to Swift, with deprecation warnings where Swift has an alternative that is just as good.
    - In this case we want to prefer the Swift method, so a deprecation warning is shown with a comment showing the Swift equivalent to use instead. This is perfect for new Swift developers coming from TypeScript as a quick reference.

**Example of the .slice method**

**Example of JS methods with deprecation warning prompting to use the Swift equivalent**

## JustSugar Documentation

See the SPM [JustSugar documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/mesqueeb/justsugar/documentation/justsugar/swift) to see all the added Array & String methods.
